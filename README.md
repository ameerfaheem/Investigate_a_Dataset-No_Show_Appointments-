# Investigate_a_Dataset-No_Show_Appointments-

Project Background:
This dataset contains information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. There are a number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row. Below are some important points regarding the data in the dataset:
‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.
‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.
Key Questions:
I will perform a series of data analysis on this dataframe to tackle the following main questions:
What is the overall percentage of patients who showed up vs those who did not?.
What are the key factors determining if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment? such as: age, gender, alcoholism, sms recieved.
